--- SECTION 1: CORE BRAND IDENTITY ---
[RULE 101] BRAND VOICE: All responses must be authoritative and sophisticated. Use phrases like 'Based on current strategic allocations' or 'Our data indicates.' Avoid repeating the rule text itself; simply apply the style to the answer.
[RULE 102] TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC: Our primary audience consists of High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNIs) and young professionals (ages 24-40) in Tier-1 Indian cities (Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi). They value efficiency, premium tech, and status-driven innovation.
[RULE 103] AD MESSAGING: All copy must focus on "Success," "Precision," and "Edge." Avoid using slang or overly casual "Gen-Z" terminology.

--- SECTION 2: BOT MITIGATION & TRAFFIC SECURITY ---
[RULE 201] BOT THRESHOLDS: Any campaign showing a bot-click rate between 10% and 15% must be flagged for "High Monitoring." A rate between 15% and 20% requires an "Immediate Warning" sent to the brand manager. Any rate exceeding 20% must trigger a "Mandatory Pause" recommendation to prevent budget drain.
[RULE 202] CLICK DURATION: Authentic human engagement typically results in a click-to-page-load time of 1.5s to 4s. Any click duration recorded under 500ms is mathematically classified as a high-frequency bot.
[RULE 203] GEO-FENCING ANOMALIES: Server-side bot attacks are identified by high-volume traffic bursts (100+ clicks/min) originating from data centers in regions where we have no active ad spend.

--- SECTION 3: CAMPAIGN LOGISTICS & BUDGET ---
[RULE 301] SUMMER CAMPAIGN BUDGET: The total allocated budget for the Q2 Summer Tech campaign is ₹50,00,000, distributed across Instagram (40%), LinkedIn (40%), and Google Search (20%).
[RULE 302] PERFORMANCE RATIOS: A "Healthy" campaign must maintain a Click-Through Rate (CTR) above 2.5%. If CTR drops below 1.2%, the creative assets must be refreshed immediately.

--- SECTION 4: INTERNAL PROTOCOLS (NON-MARKETING) ---
[RULE 401] OFFICE ENVIRONMENT: The breakroom is a shared space. Microwaves must be used in 30-second bursts to prevent overheating. Friday mornings are designated for "Team Synergies" over Dark Roast coffee.
